# 🌿 TreeSet Examples in Java (T1 – T12)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains a collection of examples demonstrating the use of **TreeSet in Java**.
It includes multiple Java files (T1 to T12) created as part of an assignment to understand how the `TreeSet` class works within the Java Collections Framework.

TreeSet stores **unique elements in sorted order** and internally uses a **Red-Black Tree** structure for efficient data management.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this assignment is to learn:

* How TreeSet maintains **automatic sorting**
* Difference between List, HashSet, and TreeSet
* Handling unique elements (No Duplicates Allowed)
* Performing operations like add, remove, search, and iteration
* Understanding NavigableSet and SortedSet behavior

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Concept:** Java Collections Framework
* **Data Structure:** TreeSet (Red-Black Tree Based)
* **IDE:** Eclipse / VS Code / IntelliJ
* **Platform:** Console Application

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```id="v5z6pl"
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

2️⃣ Open the project in your Java IDE.

3️⃣ Compile any example file:

```id="3t6en2"
javac T1.java
```

4️⃣ Run the program:

```id="7ub3zh"
java T1
```

You can execute T2 to T12 in the same way.
